Title: Employee Locator
By: Patrick Tarlit

Summary: Basically this is an android application that allows every employee 
         to track the location of their co-workers during work hours. If they 
         need something to their co-worker(s) they can use the application to 
         know the exact location of the employee that they're looking for. This
         is benificial to the company, because they can monitor their employees 
         if they're in the workplace or not.
