Title: Employee Locator
By: Patrick Tarlit

Summary: Basically this is an android application that allows every employee 
         to track the location of their co-workers during work hours. If they 
         need something to their co-worker(s) they can use the application to 
         know the exact location of the employee that they're looking for. This
         is benificial to the company, because they can monitor their employees 
         if they're in the workplace or not.

Issue #2 from MrValdez. Privacy concerns.

What privacy concerns, if any, are in your startup app?
How would you answer those concerns when asked?

- The application will only use during work hours. The users are not required to 
  use it at home unless it needed.
